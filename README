pySemon
=======

A python library to play with Semantic Ontology in OWL format.

See: http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/


This library allows to convert OWL file to INI format and back.
The idea was to give you a tool to easily create an OWL ontology
but without having to deal with the XML directly, and of course
do this in python (there are already tools available in Java,
such as Protege: http://protege.stanford.edu/)

Not everything is fully working yet, this is more a playground
project to see how things can go.
